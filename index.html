<p class="roro">Back in 2012, the Philippine government started a campaign that branded the country as a perfect destination for beach bums and dive lovers. The slogan "It's More Fun in the Philippines" played a crucial role to educate people how fun it would be to visit the country.</p>
<p class="roro1">With more than 7000 tropical islands to choose from, the Philippines is a beach bum's delight. There's an island to suit every taste, from marooned slicks of sand in the middle of the ocean, to volcanic fantasy-scapes concealing hidden lagoons, to sprawling mega-islands such as Luzon and Mindanao. Sun worshippers and divers should head straight to the Visayas, where island-hopping opportunities abound and the perfect beach takes many forms. More adventurous travellers can pitch a tent on a deserted stretch of coastline in Palawan and play solo Survivor for a few days.</p>

<p class="roro2">The Philippines is justifiably famous for its beaches, but sporty types need not feel left out. While surfers are just catching on to the tasty (if fickle) waves that form on both coasts, divers have long been enamoured of the country’s underwater charms. Northern Palawan is perfect for sea kayakers, and Boracay and Pagudpud (North Luzon) are world-class kiteboarding destinations. Back on terra firma, trekking can be done just about anywhere, while mountain-bike and canyoneering tours are gaining popularity. And the Philippines is also, unofficially, the zipline capital of the world.
This is the Famous Mount Mayon of the Philippines</p>

		This is the Banaue rice terraces, Banaue is directly accessible from Manila and can sometimes get overwhelmed by visitors.It's hard to blame them: the local mud-walled rice terraces are pleasingly different from the stone-walled terraces in most of the Cordillera. World Heritage listed, they're impressive not only for their chiselled beauty but because they were introduced around 2000 years ago.

Every town in the Philippines, no matter how big or small, holds a fiesta. Traditionally, the fiesta is a time of joyful celebration for Filipinos, who cook heaps of hearty food, throw open their doors to visitors, and parade in the streets. Some Filipino fiestas have evolved into elaborate, multi-day festivals, while others have kept their community roots. Here, we list the best fiestas across the Philippines.

		The centre of the action is dreamy White Beach, a 4km, postcard-perfect stretch of sand lined from one end to the other with hotels, restaurants, bars and dive shops several blocks deep. The beach path is typically awash with visitors, including large groups of package tourists. The ocean is full of romantic paraws (an outrigger sailboat) giving rides; colourful parasails fill the air. After perfect sunsets, live music breaks out, and fire dancers twirl their batons. A: Boracay is famous for its pristine white beaches, thrilling water activities and great nightlife experiences.

		<h2>Adobo</h2>
		<p class="wrap4">
		
		This famous dish was influenced by the Spanish when they invaded and settled in the Philippines during the 16th centrury. Adobo originated from the word Adouber which means “to dress meat in vinegar or spices”. As the century went by, the word Adouber changed to Adobar, to Adobado, and finally, Adobo. 

There is a vast variety in the way Adobo is prepared and cooked across the different regions of the country, but there is one ingredient that is a must and is seen as the heart and soul of this dish: vinegar. Adobo’s other basic ingredients include soy sauce, garlic, bay leaf, and peppercorns

		<h2>Kare-Kare</h2>
		<p>
		The process starts with tenderizing the ox tail, beef, and (sometimes) ox tripe for almost two hours. It is then cooked with ground peanuts and creamy peanut butter, seasoned with fish sauce, and finished off with bok choy, string beans, and eggplants. Kare-kare is a real crowd pleaser as its nutty-sweet and savory flavors excite the taste buds with an explosion of flavors. This dish has to be eaten with rice, otherwise the flavors can be overwhelming.

		<h2>Dinuguan</h2>
		<p>
		Dinuguan comes from the word “dugo”, which translates as blood, and is a savory Filipino pork blood stew made of diced pork, vinegar, pork blood, and chili peppers. Some people like using pork offal such as intestines or other pork body parts, although this is an acquired taste. Dinuguan is savory but not heavily salty and usually has a sour note. The texture varies widely from a fairly thin soup to a thick, dark grainy stew. This special dish is usually served at weddings, fiestas, and in Lechon houses.

The most common types of Pansit are: Pansit Bihon (thin bihon noodles), Pansit Canton (thick egg noodles), Sotanghon (thin glass noodles), to name a few.
